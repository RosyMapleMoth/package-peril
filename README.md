In Package Peril, you must deliver packages to the countless many. You must deliver as many packages as you can within a strict time limit.

You must pack your truck with packages, a max of five spawned at any given time, and deliver them to the listed address. And yes, we know it will be annoying to do with the current build.

a package is delivered when it is placed in front of the correct house the package will turn blue

Switch between package mode and driving mode with ‘Q’. In package mode, use WASD as movement. Your left click picks up packages, and drops them on release. If you press right click while holding a package, you throw it.

In driving mode, use the W and S as the forwards and backwards movement, AD as steering, and ‘Space’ as break. H honks your horn.
